Imagine an ecommerce website which can sell an unlimited number of units of 5 different items without any storage cost.
In every webpage, a single product, called primary, is displayed together with its price. The user can add a number of units of this product to the cart. After the product has been added to the cart, two products, called secondary, are recommended. When displaying the secondary products, the price is hidden. Furthermore, the products are recommended in two slots, one above the other, thus providing more importance to the product displayed in the slot above. If the user clicks on a secondary product, a new tab on the browser is opened and, in the loaded webpage, the clicked product is displayed as primary together with its price. At the end of the visit over the ecommerce website, the user buys the products added to the cart.
We assume that the user has the following behavior:
* she/he buys a number of units of the primary product if the price of a single unit is under the user’ reservation price; in other words, the users’ reservation price is not over the cumulative price of the multiple units, but only over the single unit;
* once the primary product has been bought, the user clicks on a secondary product with a probability depending on the primary product except when the secondary product has been already displayed as primary in the past, in this case the click probability is zero (thus, in practice, excluding the case in which a product is displayed as primary more than once --- as a result the number of webpages visited by the user is finite);
* when observing the secondary products, the user initially observes the first slot and, after having observed that slot, observes the second slot. Assume that the probability with which the first slot is observed is 1, while the probability with which the second slot is observed is lambda < 1. The value of lambda is assumed to be known in all the three project proposals.
Notice that the probability of a click on a secondary product depends on:
* the purchase probability of the primary product,
* the probability to observe the slot in which the secondary product is displayed, and the click probability of the secondary product conditioned to the purchase of the primary.
We provide the following simple example to clarify the setting better.

We are given five products P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, each corresponding to a node of the graph above. Every directed edge between two products is associated with a weight. Given a primary product P and a secondary product P’, the weight of the edge starting from P and ending in P’ provides the probability with which the user clicks on P’ while displayed in the first slot with product P as the main product. For instance, if the primary product is P2 and the secondary products are P1, in the first slot, and P4, in the second slot, the probabilities that the user clicks on P1 and P4 are 0.1 and 0.3 * lambda. The absence of an edge means that the corresponding probability is zero. Consider now another case. When the primary product is P2 and the secondary products are P1 and P4, the user can buy a number of units of P2 and then click on one of both secondary products. Assume, for instance, that the user clicks on P4 and therefore P4 is displayed as the primary product, along with, e.g., P1 and P3 displayed as secondary products. Notice that, from now on, if P2 is displayed as a secondary product, the probability that the user clicks on it is zero independently of the slot in which it is displayed.
For simplicity, we make the following assumptions:
* the clicks on the secondary products are independent of each other and the user can click on multiple secondary products, so as to activate multiple parallel paths over the graph depicted above;
* the number of items a user will buy is a random variable independent of any other variable; that is, the user decides first whether to buy or not the products and, subsequently, in the case of a purchase, the number of units to buy;
* the actions performed by the users are perfectly observable by the ecommerce website.
Every day, there is a random number of potential new customers (returning customers are not considered here). In particular, every single customer can land on the webpage in which one of the 5 products is primary or on the webpage of a product sold by a (non-strategic) competitor. Call 𝛼_i the ratio of customers landing on the webpage in which product Pi is primary, and call 𝛼_0 the ratio of customers landing on the webpage of a competitor. In practice, you can only consider the 𝛼 ratios and disregard the total number of users. However, the 𝛼 ratios will be subject to noise. That is, every day, the value of the 𝛼 ratios will be realizations of independent Dirichlet random variables.
The following picture summarizes the overall scenario.

In the following project proposals, we ask you to develop two different settings differing for the graph weights. First, assume that the graph is fully connected and therefore all the edges have strictly positive probabilities (in practice the secondary products displayed are just two and thus many of the edges are useless). In the second, assume that the graph is not fully connected and therefore some edges have zero probability.
The behavior of the user in the graph is similar to that of the social influence. Thus, in the following project proposals, you need to resort to social influence techniques to evaluate the probabilities with which the user reaches the webpage with some specific primary product.
